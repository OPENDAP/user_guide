== 1 The OPeNDAP Server ==
Any server that responds to the messages described in
link:/index.php/UserGuideOPeNDAPMessages[OPeNDAP Messages] using the
link:/index.php/UserGuideDataModel[OPeNDAP Data Model] is an OPeNDAP
server. The messages and the data model are published standards,
available to anyone to use.

The OPeNDAP group, in addition to publishing and maintaining the
standards described here, maintains a server that complies with the
standard. This is link:/index.php/Hyrax[Hyrax].

=== 1.1 Hyrax ===

The OPeNDAP group produces and supports link:/index.php/Hyrax[Hyrax], a
modular data server that can be used in a variety of ways to serve a
wide variety of data with OPeNDAP.

Hyrax is flexible enough that it can serve data that currently exist in
a wide variety of data storage formats, ranging from HDF4 data files to
netCDF data to data in some arbitrary non-standard format using the
FreeForm module.

Hyrax is modular, too, which means it can be outfitted to serve the
particular needs of your data without weighing down its performance with
features you don’t need.

==== 1.1.1 How Hyrax Works ====

The link:/index.php/Hyrax[Hyrax] server is actually a combination of two
distinct servers, running on the same machine, or on two machines
connected with a very fast link. One server serves as the user-facing
``front end'' to the system, while the other provides the ``engine
room'', optimized to turn requests around quickly.

The front end server is called the **O**PeNDAP **L**ightweight **F**ront
end **S**erver (OLFS). It receives requests for data and services in
multiple formats and forms, and is meant to be as ``user friendly'' as a
server can be. It also handles such chores as authentication and
authorization-checking, and responding to catalog and bot requests. It
can also construct complex data requests from multiple requests from its
parner server.

// .The Hyrax Architecture

This other server, called the **B**ack **E**nd **S**erver (BES), does
only one thing—provide data—and is designed to do it fast. It handles
the compute-intensive parts of processing an OPeNDAP client request for
data. This results in higher performance for small requests while not
penalizing the larger requests.

Separating the two roles allows several paths to optimizing a server,
while still resulting in higher performance for small requests. An OLFS
controlling multiple BES processes on a machine can process multiple
requests quicker because while one BES is occupied with retrieving its
data, another can be processing its data. An OLFS controlling BES
processes on multiple machines can implement a rudimentary
load-balancing scheme to protect servers from overload. What’s more,
compute-intensive clients can optimize their processes further by
sending requests directly to the BES.

==== 1.1.2 Installing Hyrax ====

The two parts of link:/index.php/Hyrax[Hyrax] are both installed by the
same script, but they are two different animals, which may require
different kinds of attention from an administrator. Testing OLFS
requires a working BES, so it’s typical to start the post-unpacking
process with the BES.

// [[installing-bes]]

===== 1.1.2.1 Installing BES =====

The BES is a standalone server. Its installation involves parking its
code somewhere to be run as a daemon and configuring your system to
execute it.

After that, though, there are several configuration options you’ll need
to address by installing software on your machine, and by editing the
link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_BES_Configuration[Hyrax configuration file],
called bes.xml. Details of these options are in the
link:/index.php/Hyrax[Hyrax] documentation, but these are the decisions
you’ll have to make:

What kind of data ::
  Hyrax is equipped to serve data stored in any of several different
  file formats, HDF, netCDF and others. Each different format requires
  its own handler, and your machine must have shared libraries
  containing these handlers installed. For example, in order to serve
  netCDF data, the netCDF handler library must be available to Hyrax,
  and identified in its
  link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_BES_Configuration[configuration file]. The
  handlers are shared libraries and are installed separately. Find
  instructions under
  link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_BES_Configuration#Loading_Handlers[Loading
  Handlers].

Where the data lives ::
  A server equipped to serve data must be able to find that data. Lines
  in the bes.xml file identify the disk location of your data files.
  Hyrax can provide a limited amount of browsing capacity to users,
  through its
  link:/index.php/UserGuideOPeNDAPMessages#WWW_Interface_Service[WWW
  interface]. Access is specified by identifying directories where data
  resides. See
  link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_BES_Configuration[Pointing_to_data].

What kinds of services ::
  Along with simply supplying data, Hyrax can supply several different
  services, including
  link:/index.php/UserGuideOPeNDAPMessages#ASCII_Service[serving the
  data as ASCII values], and the form-driven
  link:/index.php/UserGuideOPeNDAPMessages#WWW_Interface_Service[WWW
  interface]. The bes.xml file is used to specify the list of services.
  The drivers for these services are installed as part of the default
  installation of Hyrax, but they need to be chosen and identified in
  bes.xml. See instructions at
  link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_BES_Configuration#Loading_Handlers[Loading
  Handlers].

Once these three tasks are accomplished, and once data is moved into the
appropriate directories, your server should be ready to provide data to
all comers, but most specifically to its OLFS.

// [[the-freeform-module]]
// [[The_FreeForm_Module]]1.1.2.1.1 The FreeForm Module
// reformatted title lb 7/11/16
===== 1.1.2.1.1 The FreeForm Module =====

One of the shared libraries to use for serving data is called the
FreeForm module. This module allows you to serve data in fairly
arbitrary formats by writing a format description file to sit alongside
your data file. If you have data that isn’t in one of the supported file
formats, consider writing format descriptions using FreeForm, and
serving the data that way.

See the link:/index.php/FreeForm[FreeForm documentation] for more
information.

// [[Installing_OLFS]]1.1.2.2 Installing OLFS
// ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// reformatted title lb 7/11/16
===== 1.1.2.2 Installing OLFS =====

The OLFS is a Java servlet, so its installation involves installing the
Tomcat servlet infrastructure, and then configuring that with the OLFS.
There are four configuration files, but unless yours is an unusual case,
you’ll likely only have to look at two of them. See
link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_OLFS_Configuration[Hyrax_-_OLFS_Configuration]
for more information.

Use the
link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_OLFS_Configuration#olfs.xml_Configuration_File[olfs.xml]
file to specify these important features of the OLFS operation:

Address of BES ::
  The OLFS is the front door to data from the BES. Use the olfs.xml file
  to identify where to find this server. See the instructions for the
  link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_OLFS_Configuration#BESManager[BESManager].

Dispatch handlers ::
  The OLFS ``offers'' the incoming URL to a series of ``dispatch
  handlers'' until one accepts it and executes. This allows the OLFS to
  offer directory and catalog services, as well as data services and
  more. Use the olfs.xml file to nominate the dispatch handlers (they
  come with the OLFS, and do not need to be separately installed). See
  link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_OLFS_Configuration#HTTP_GET_Handlers[handler
  instructions] for more.

Catalog requests ::
  The OLFS can handle
  link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_THREDDS_Configuration[THREDDS] catalog
  requests, as well as directory requests, an older part of the DAP
  standard that also involves data about a collection of data files. The
  THREDDS information can be static (provided from a file) or dynamic
  (generated by a review of the available data).

File access ::
  You may have individual files you want served intact via this server.
  These might include documentation of the data files, or of the server.
  See
  link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_OLFS_Configuration#File_Dispatch_Handler[File
  Dispatch Handler] instructions.

There are some other features, too, like a bot blocker and a version
message, as well as the experimental SOAP message handler. These are
also configured with
link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_OLFS_Configuration#olfs.xml_Configuration_File[olfs.xml],
and you’ll find more information about them at the link.

The other configuration file you might need to edit is
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/THREDDS/tech/TDS.html[catalog.xml],
briefly reviewed under link:#THREDDS[THREDDS], below.

// [[thredds]]

===== 1.1.2.3 THREDDS =====

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/THREDDS/tech/TDS.html[THREDDS] is a
catalog standard for scientific data promoted by scientists at
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu[UCAR]. It allows

// + deleted lb 7/11/16
The default file will allow dynamic catalogs to be created and should
allow your server to respond to THREDDS requests properly. It’s possible
you may want to serve a static THREDDS catalog, too. This can be done by
editing the catalog.xml file, and you’ll find links to instructions for
that at link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_THREDDS_Configuration[Hyrax - THREDDS
Configuration].

// reformatted title lb 7/11/16
===== 1.1.2.4 Multiple BES Configuration =====

You can configure a single OLFS to work with multiple BES instances.
This offers an opportunity to do rudimentary load balancing, or to
isolate data on one server or another. See the
link:/index.php/Hyrax_-_Configuring_The_OLFS_To_Work_With_Multiple_BES%27s[Hyrax
configuration chapter] for more information on the subject.
