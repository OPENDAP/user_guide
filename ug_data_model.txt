[[Data_and_Data_Models]]1 Data and Data Models
----------------------------------------------

Basic to the operation of OPeNDAP is its data model, and the set of
messages that define the communication between client and server. This
chapter presents the data model, and the next
link:/index.php/UserGuideOPeNDAPMessages[presents the messages].

[[data-models]]
[[Data_Models]]1.1 Data Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any data set is made up of data and a data model. The data model defines
the type and arrangement of data values, and may be thought of as an
abstract representation of the relationship between one data value and
another. Though it may seem paradoxical, it is precisely this
relationship that defines the meaning of some number. Without the
context provided by a data model, a number does not represent anything.
For example, within some data set, it may be apparent that a number
represents the value of temperature at some point in space and time.
Without its neighboring temperature measurements, and without the
latitude, longitude, height (or depth), and time, the same number means
nothing.

As the model only defines an abstract set of relationships, two data
sets containing different data may share the same data model. For
example, the data produced by two different measurements with the same
instrument will use the same data model, though the values of the data
are different. Sometimes two models may be equivalent. For example, an
XBT (eXpendable BathyThermograph) measures a time series of temperature
near the surface of the ocean, but is usually stored as a series of
temperature and depth measurements. The temperature vs. time model of
the original data is equivalent to the temperature vs. depth model of
the stored data.

In a computational sense, a data model may be considered to be the data
type or collection of data types used to represent that data. A
temperature measurement might occur as half an entry in a sequence of
temperature and depth pairs. However the data model also includes the
scalar latitude, longitude and date that identify the time and place
where the temperature measurements were taken. Thus the data set might
be represented in a C-like syntax like this:

....
Dataset {
   Float64 lat;
   Float64 lon;
   Int32 minutes;
   Int32 day;
   Int32 year;
   Sequence {
      Float64 depth;
      Float64 temperature;
   } cast;
} xbt-station;
....

Example Data Description of XBT Station

 +
The above example describes a data set that contains all the data from a
single XBT. The data set is called xbt-station, and contains
floating-point representations of the latitude and longitude of the
station, and three integers that specify _when_ the XBT measurements
were made. The xbt-station contains a single sequence (called cast) of
measurements, which are here represented as values for depth and
temperature.

A slightly different data model representing the same data might look
like this:

....
Dataset {
   Structure {
      Float64 lat;
      Float64 lon;
   } location;
   Structure {
      Int32 minutes;
      Int32 day;
      Int32 year;
   } time;
   Sequence {
      Float64 depth;
      Float64 temperature;
   } cast;
} xbt-station;
....

Example Data Description of XBT Station Using Structures

 +

In this example, several of the data have been grouped, implying a
relation between them. The nature of the relationship is not defined,
but it is clear that lat and lon are both components of location, and
that each measurement in the cast sequence is made up of depth and
temperature values.

In these two examples, meaning was added to the data set only by
providing a more refined context for the data values. No other data was
added, but still the second example can be said to contain more
information than the first one.

These two examples are refinements of the same basic arrangement of
data. However, there is nothing that says that a completely different
data model can’t be just as useful or just as accurate. For example, the
depth and temperature data, instead of being represented by a sequence
of pairs could be represented by a pair of sequences or arrays:

....
Dataset {
   Structure {
      Float64 lat;
      Float64 lon;
   } location;
   Structure {
      Int32 minutes;
      Int32 day;
      Int32 year;
   } time;
   Float64 depth[500];
   Float64 temperature[500];
} xbt-station;
....

Example Data Description of XBT Station Using Arrays

 +
The relationship between the depth and temperature variables is no
longer quite as clear, but, depending on what sort of processing is
intended, this may not be that important a loss.

The choice of a computational data model to contain some data set
depends in many cases on the whims and preferences of the user, as well
as on the data analysis software to be used. Several different data
models may be equally useful for a given task. Of course, some data
models will contain more information about the data than others, but
this information can also be carried in a researcher’s head.

Note that with a carefully chosen set of data type constructors, such as
those we’ve used in the preceding examples, a user can implement an
infinite number of data models. The examples above use the OPeNDAP
Dataset Descriptor Structure (DDS) format, which will become important
in later discussions of the details of the OPeNDAP Data Access Protocol.
The precise details of the DDS syntax are described in
link:/index.php/UserGuideOPeNDAPMessages#Dataset_Descriptor_Structure[DDS].

[[data-models-and-apis]]
[[Data_Models_and_APIs]]1.1.1 Data Models and APIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A data access Application Program Interface (API) is a library of
functions designed to be used by a computer program to read, write, and
sample data. Any given data access API can be said to define implicitly
some data model. (Or, at least, it will define restrictions on the data
model you can use.) That is, the functions that make up the API accept
and return data using a certain collection of computational data types:
multi-dimensional arrays might be required for some data, scalars for
others, sequences for others. This collection of data types, and their
use constitute the data model represented by that API. (Or data
models—there is no reason an API cannot accommodate several different
models.)

 +

[[translating-data-models]]
[[Translating_Data_Models]]1.1.2 Translating Data Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The problem of data model translation is central to the implementation
of OPeNDAP. With an effective data translator, an OPeNDAP program
originally designed to read netCDF data can have some access to data
sets that use an incompatible data model, such as JGOFS.

In general, it is not possible to define an algorithm that will
translate data from any model to any other, without losing information
defined by the position of data values or the relations between them.
Some of these incompatibilities are obvious; a data model designed for
time series data may not be able to accommodate multi-dimensional
arrays. Others are more subtle. For example, a Sequence looks very
similar to a collection of Arrays in many respects. But this does not
mean they can always be translated from one to the other. For example,
some APIs only return one Sequence ``instance'' at a time. This means
that even if a Sequence of sets of three numbers is more or less the
same shape as three parallel Arrays, it will be very difficult to model
the one kind of behavior on the other kind of API.

However, even though the general problem isn’t solvable, there are many
useful translations that can be done, and there are many others that are
still useful despite their inherent information loss.

For example, consider a relational structure like the one below. This is
similar to the examples in #Data_Models, but contains two nested
Sequences. The outer Sequence represents all the XBT drops in a cruise,
and the inner Sequence represents each XBT drop. The JGOFS API was
designed to use this sort of data type.

....
Dataset {
   Sequence {
      Int32 id;
      Float64 latitude;
      Float64 longitude;
      Sequence {
         Float64 depth;
         Float64 temperature;
      } xbt_drop;
   } station;
} cruise;
....

Example Data Description of XBT Cruise

 +
Note that each entry in the cruise sequence is composed of a tuple of
data values (one of which is itself a sequence). Were we to arrange
these data values as a table, they might look like this:

....
id   lat   lon   depth  temp
1   10.8   60.8    0     70
                  10     46
                  20     34
2   11.2   61.0    0     71
                  10     45
                  20     34
3   11.6   61.2    0     69
                  10     47
                  20     34 
....

This can be made into an array, although that introduces redundancy.

....
id   lat   lon   depth  temp
1   10.8   60.8    0     70
1   10.8   60.8   10     46
1   10.8   60.8   20     34
2   11.2   61.0    0     71
2   11.2   61.0   10     45
2   11.2   61.0   20     34
3   11.6   61.2    0     69
3   11.6   61.2   10     47
3   11.6   61.2   20     34
....

The data is now in a form that may be read by an API such as netCDF. But
consider the analysis stage. Suppose a user wants to see graphs of each
station’s data. It is not obvious simply from the arrangement of the
array where a station stops and the next one begins. Analyzing data in
this format is not a function likely to be accommodated by a program
that uses the netCDF API, even though it is theoretically possible to
implement.

[[data-access-protocol]]
[[Data_Access_Protocol]]1.2 Data Access Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OPeNDAP Data Access Protocol (DAP) defines how an OPeNDAP client and
an OPeNDAP server communicate with one another to pass data from the
server to the client. The job of the functions in the OPeNDAP client
library is to translate data from the DAP into the form expected by the
data access API for which the OPeNDAP library is substituting. The job
of an OPeNDAP server is to translate data stored on a disk in whatever
format they happen to be stored in to the DAP for transmission to the
client.

The DAP consists of several components:

 +

1.  An ``intermediate data representation'' for data sets. This is used
to transport data from the remote source to the client. The data types
that make up this representation may be thought of as the OPeNDAP data
model.
2.  A format for the ``ancillary data'' needed to translate a data set
into the intermediate representation, and to translate the intermediate
representation into the target data model. The ancillary data in turn
consists of two pieces:
* A description of the shape and size of the various data types stored
in some given data set. This is called the Data Description Structure
(DDS).
* Capsule descriptions of some of the properties of the data stored in
some given data set. This is the Data Attribute Structure (DAS).
3.  A ``procedure'' for retrieving data and ancillary data from remote
platforms.
4.  An ``API'' consisting of OPeNDAP classes and data access calls
designed to implement the protocol,

The intermediate data representation and the ancillary data formats are
introduced in link:/index.php/UserGuideOPeNDAPMessages[OPeNDAP
Messages], as are the steps of the procedure. The actual details of the
software used to implement these formats and procedures is a subject of
the documentation of the respective software.

[[data-representation]]
[[Data_representation]]1.3 Data representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many popular data storage formats, and many more than that in
use. These formats are optimized (it they are optimized at all) for data
storage, and are not generally suitable for data transmission. In order
to transmit data over the Internet, OPeNDAP must translate the data
model used by a particular storage format into the data model used for
transmission.

If the data model for transmission is defined to be general enough to
encompass the abstractions of several data models for storage, than this
intermediate representation—the transmission format—can be used to
translate between one data model and another.

The OPeNDAP data model consists of a fairly elementary set of base
types, combined with an advanced set of constructs and operators that
allows it to define data types of arbitrary complexity. This way, the
OPeNDAP data access protocol can be used to transmit data from virtually
any data storage format.

The elements of the OPeNDAP data access protocol are:

 +

Base Types ::
  These are the simple data types, like integers, floating point
  numbers, strings, and character data.
Constructor ::
  Types These are the more complex data types that can be constructed
  from the simple base types. Examples are structures, sequences,
  arrays, and grids.
Operators ::
  Access to data can be operationally defined with operators defined on
  the various data types.
 External Data Representation ::
  In order to transmit the data across the Internet, there needs to be a
  machine-independent definition of what the various data types look
  like. For example, the client and server need to agree on the most
  significant digit of a particular byte in the message

These elements are defined in greater detail in the sections that
follow.

[[base-types]]
[[Base_Types]]1.3.1 Base Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OPeNDAP data model uses the concepts of variables and operators.
Each data set is defined by a set of one or more variables, and each
variable is defined by a set of attributes. A variable’s
__attributes__—such as units, name and type—must not be confused with
the data _value_ (or values) that may be represented by that variable. A
variable called time may contain an integer number of minutes, but it
does not contain a particular number of minutes until a context, such as
a specific event recorded in a data set, is provided. Each variable may
further be the object of an operator that defines a subset of the
available data set.

Variables in the DAP have two forms. They are either base types or type
constructors. Base type variables are similar to predefined variables in
procedural programming languages like C or Fortran (such as int or
integer*4). While these certainly have an internal structure, it is not
possible to access parts of that structure using the DAP. Base type
variables in the DAP have two predefined attributes (or
characteristics): name, and type. They are defined as follows:

 +

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
--
Name ::
  A unique identifier that can be used to reference the part of the
  dataset associated with this variable.

 +

Type ::
  The data type contained by the variable. This can be one of Byte,
  Int32, UInt32, Float64, String, and URL. Where:

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
* Byte is a single byte of data. This is the same as unsigned char in
ANSI C.
* Int16 is a 16 bit two’s complement integer—it is synonymous with long
in ANSI C when that type is implemented as 16 bits.
* UInt16 is a 16 bit unsigned integer.
* Int32 is a 32 bit two’s complement integer—it is synonymous with long
in ANSI C when that type is implemented as 32 bits.
* UInt32 is a 32 bit unsigned integer.
* Float32 is the IEEE 32 bit floating point data type.
* Float64 is the IEEE 64 bit floating point data type.
* String is a sequence of bytes terminated by a null character.
* Url is a string containing an OPeNDAP URL.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The declaration in a
link:/index.php/UserGuideOPeNDAPMessages#Data_Descriptor_Structure[DDS]
of a variable of any of the base types is simply the type of the
variable, followed by its name, and a semicolon. For example, to declare
a month variable to be a 32-bit integer, one would type:

....
Int32 month;
....

[[constructor-types]]
[[Constructor_Types]]1.3.2 Constructor Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Constructor types, such as arrays and structures, describe the grouping
of one or more variables within a dataset. These classes are used to
describe different types of relations between the variables that
comprise the dataset. For example, an array might indicate that the
variables grouped are all measurements of the same quantity with some
spatial relation to one another, whereas a structure might indicate a
grouping of measurements of disparate quantities that happened at the
same place and time.

There are six classes of type constructor variables defined by the
OPeNDAP DAP: arrays, structures, sequences, functions, and grids. The
types are defined as:

[[array]]
[[Array]]1.3.2.1 Array
++++++++++++++++++++++

An array is a one dimensional indexed data structure as defined by ANSI
C. Multidimensional arrays are defined as arrays of arrays. An array may
be subsampled using subscripts or ranges of subscripts enclosed in
brackets ([]). For example, temp[3][4] would indicate the value in the
fourth row and fifth column of the temp array. (As in C, OPeNDAP array
indices start at zero.)

A chunk of an array may be specified with subscript ranges; the array
temp[2:10][3:4] indicates an array of nine rows and two columns whose
values have been lifted intact from the larger temp array.

 +
A _hyperslab_ may be selected from an array with a _stride_ value. The
array represented by temp[2:2:10][3:4] would have only five rows; the
middle value in the first subscript range indicates that the output
array values are to be selected from alternate input array rows. The
array temp[2:3:10][3:4] would select from every third row, and so on.

A
link:/index.php/UserGuideOPeNDAPMessages#Data_Descriptor_Structure[DDS]
declaration of a 5x6 array of floating point numbers would look like
this:

....
Float64 data[5][6];
....

In addition to its magnitude, every dimension of an array may also have
a name. The previous declaration could be written:

....
Float64 data[height = 5][width = 6];
....

[[structure]]
[[Structure]]1.3.2.2 Structure
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A Structure is a class that may contain several variables of different
classes. However, though it implies that its member variables are
related somehow, it conveys no relational information about them. The
structure type can also be used to group a set of unrelated variables
together into a single dataset. The ``dataset'' class name is a synonym
for structure.

A
link:/index.php/UserGuideOPeNDAPMessages#Data_Descriptor_Structure[DDS]
Structure declaration containing some data and the month in which the
data was taken might look like this:

....
   Structure {
      Int32 month;
      Float64 data[5][6];
   } measurement;
....

Use the *.* operator to refer to members of a Structure. For example,
measurement.month would identify the integer member of the Structure
defined in the above declaration.

 +

[[sequence]]
[[Sequence]]1.3.2.3 Sequence
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A Sequence is an ordered set of variables each of which may have several
values. The variables may be of different classes. Each element of a
Sequence consists of a value for each member variable, so a Sequence is
sort of like an ordered set of Structures.

Thus a Sequence can be represented as:

[cols=",,,",]
|======================
|s~00~ |s~01~ |… |s~0n~
|s~10~ |s~11~ |… |s~1n~
|s~20~ |s~21~ |… |s~2n~
|. |… |… |.
|. |… |… |.
|. |… |… |.
|s~i0~ |s~i1~ |… |s~in~
|======================

 +
Every instance of Sequence S has the same number, order, and class of
its member variables. A Sequence implies that each of the variables is
related to each other in some logical way. For example, a Sequence
containing position and temperature measurements might imply that each
temperature measurement was taken at the corresponding position. A
Sequence is different from a Structure because its constituent variables
have several instances while a Structure’s variables have only one
instance (or value).

A Sequence declaration is similar to a Structure’s. For example, the
following would define a Sequence that would contain many members like
the Structure defined above:

....
   Sequence {
      Int32 month;
      Float64 data[5][6];
   } measurement;
....

Note that, unlike an Array, a Sequence has no index. This means that a
Sequence’s values are not simultaneously accessible. Instead, a Sequence
has an implied __state__, corresponding to a single element in the
Sequence.

As with a Structure, the variable measurement.month has a single value.
The distinction is that this variable’s value changes depending on the
state of the Sequence. You can think of a Sequence as composed of the
data you get from successive reads of data from a file. The data values
available at any point are the last values read from the file. But you
don’t have immediate access to any of the other values in that file.

[[grid]]
[[Grid]]1.3.2.4 Grid
++++++++++++++++++++

A Grid is an association of an N dimensional array with N named vectors
(one-dimensional arrays), each of which has the same number of elements
as the corresponding dimension of the array. Each data value in the Grid
is associated with the data values in the vectors associated with its
dimensions.

As an example, consider an array of temperature values that has six
columns and five rows. Suppose that this array represents measurements
of temperature at five different depths in six different locations. The
problem is the indication of the precise location of each temperature
measurement, relative to one another.

If the six locations are evenly spaced, and the five depths are also
evenly spaced, then the data set can be completely described using the
array and two scalar values indicating the distance between adjacent
vertices of the array. However, if the spacing of the measurements is
_not_ regular, as in /index.php/File:Grid.gif[figure 6.3.2] then an
array will be inadequate. To adequately describe the positions of each
of the points in the grid, the precise location of each column and row
must be described.

/index.php/File:Grid.gif[image:/images/6/64/Grid.gif[actual
size,width=282,height=277]]

An Irregular Grid of Data.

 +
The secondary vectors in the Grid data type provide a solution to this
problem. Each member of these vectors associates a value for all the
data points in the corresponding rank of the array. The value can
represent location or time or some other quantity, and can even be a
constructor data type. The following declaration would define a data
type that could accommodate a structure like this:

....
 Grid {
      Float64 data[distance = 6][depth = 5];
      Float64 distance[6];
      Float64 depth[5];
   } measurement;
 
....

In the above example, an vector called depth contains five values
corresponding to the depths of each row of the array, while another
vector called distance contains the scalar distance between the location
of the corresponding column, and some reference point.

In a similar arrangement, a location array could instead contain six
(latitude, longitude) pairs indicating the absolute location of each
column of the grid.

....
    Grid {
      Float64 data[distance = 6][depth = 5];
      Float64 depth[5];
      Array Structure {
         Float64 latitude;
         Float64 longitude;
      } location[6];
   } measurement;
....

[[external-data-representation]]
[[External_Data_Representation]]1.3.3 External Data Representation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you know what the data types are, the next step is to define
their external representation. The DAP defines an external
representation for each of the base-type and constructor-type variables.
This is used when an object of the given type is transferred from one
computer to another. Defining a single external representation makes
possible the translation of variables from one computer to another when
those computers use different internal representations for those
variable types.

The data access protocol uses Sun Microsystems’ XDR protocol for the
external representation of all of the base type variables. The table
below shows the XDR types used to represent the various base type
variables.

 +

The XDR data types corresponding to OPeNDAP base-type variables.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|==========================
|Base Type |XDR Type
|Byte |xdr byte
|Int16 |xdr int16
|UInt16 |xdr unsigned int16
|Int32 |xdr int32
|UInt32 |xdr unsigned int32
|Float32 |xdr float
|Float64 |xdr double
|String |xdr string
|URL |xdr string
|==========================

A base type variable is always either transmitted or not. You won’t ever
see a fraction of an String type transmitted. The constructor type
variables, being made up of the bast type variables, are transmitted as
sets of base type variables, and these may be sampled, with a
link:/index.php/UserGuideOPeNDAPMessages#Constraint_Expression[constraint
expression].

Constraint expressions do not affect _how_ a base-type variable is
transmitted from a client to a server; they determine _if_ a variable is
to be transmitted. For constructor type variables, however, constraint
expressions may be used to exclude portions of the variable. For
example, if a constraint expression is used to select the first three of
six fields in a structure, the last three fields of that structure are
not transmitted by the server.

What remains is to define the external representation of the constructor
type variables. For each of the six constructor types these definitions
are:

Array ::
  An Array is sent using the xdr_array function. This means that an
  Array of 100 Int32s is sent as a single block of 100 xdr longs, not
  100 separate ``xdr long''s.
Structure ::
  A Structure is sent by encoding each field in the order those fields
  are declared in the
  link:/index.php/UserGuideOPeNDAPMessages#Data_Descriptor_Structure[DDS]
  and transmitting the resulting block of bytes.
Sequence ::
  A Sequence is transmitted by encoding each item in the sequence as if
  it were a Structure, and ending each such structure after the other,
  in the order of their occurrence in the sequence. The entire sequence
  is sent, subject to the constraint expression. In other words, if no
  constraint expression is supplied then the entire sequence is sent.
  However, if a constraint expression is given all the records in the
  sequence that satisfy the expression are sent.
Grid ::
  A Grid is encoded as if it were a Structure (one component after the
  other, in the order of their declaration).

The external data representation used by an OPeNDAP server and client
may be compressed, depending on the configuration of the respective
machines. The compression is done using the gzip program. Only the data
transmission itself will be affected by this; the transmission of the
ancillary data is not compressed.
